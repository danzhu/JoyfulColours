I'm here to tell a story.
A story about who I am.
Long ago, there were no images.
All are words. Characters. Symbols. Nothing else.
Then, as time goes by, we learn to listen.
There were voices. Shouting. Whispering.
And also, there was music. Heavenly beautiful.
But then, we all seem to have forgotten something.
What was it? A dragon? A knight? A legend?
No, it was something else.
Something we have missed for such a long time.
Something we keep forgetting and losing.
Something we never even glanced.
Oh yes, glancing!
We never SEE!
And that's where my journey begins.
