To My Beloved Joy,

There isn't that much that I can give you, since you already have everything that you need (>_<). I spent two weeks, day and night, making this little interactive present for you. Though it may not appear to be sooo great... it's the effort that worthes it, isn't it? I sincerely hope that you'd like it!

The rest of this letter is scattered throughout the school building - take some time to find them! Happy hunting!
